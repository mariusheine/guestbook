# Guestbook

A party guestbook with AI image generation (openAI's DALL-E) on each guestbook entry.

Use it on https://mariusheine.github.io/guestbook

It runs completely in the browser, which means:

- Guestbooks are stored on your client in the browser storage
- A guestbook can only be viewed and changed on the browser and computer where it was created (export/import will come)
- OpenAI api calls are also performed on the client, which means we need to ask and store your OpenAI API key in the browser storage
  - get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
